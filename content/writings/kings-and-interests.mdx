Why do billionaires suddenly switch political sides? Why do world leaders form alliances with people they once denounced?

It’s not hypocrisy. It’s interest.

In The Human Condition, political philosopher Hannah Arendt put it bluntly:

“As kings rule over people, interest rules over kings.”

We often think the powerful act out of conviction or vision—but more often, they’re just responding to what serves them best.

For most people, motivation is simple. You can get them to act with rewards or punishments—money, status, fear, desire. It’s the classic carrot-and-stick. Want someone to work harder? Pay them more. Want them to vote a certain way? Trigger identity or anxiety.

This is how the masses are moved.

But this model collapses when you deal with the rich and powerful.

Presidents, billionaires, founders—these aren’t people you can bribe with a raise or scare with small threats. They already have what most people want. What moves them is not short-term gain. It’s strategic self-interest—the alignment of outcomes with long-term goals, reputation, power, or legacy.

Once you understand this, patterns start to emerge.

A tech founder once hailed as a progressive darling suddenly backs a conservative candidate. A billionaire who opposed regulation now embraces it—because it protects their market position. They’re not selling out. They’re acting in line with their interests.

And this insight matters—not just in politics, but in persuasion, negotiation, and sales.

If you’re trying to influence someone in power—whether in a pitch meeting, a policy discussion, or a partnership deal—understand this:
Speak to interest. Not ego. Not ethics. Not buzzwords.

The same applies at every level.
If you’re selling to an entry-level employee, talk about compensation and perks.
If you’re speaking to a high-level executive, talk about positioning, outcomes, and risk.

So next time you’re trying to win someone over, ask yourself:

Are you dealing with a person… or a king?
Because if it’s the latter, you’d better know what interests rule them.
