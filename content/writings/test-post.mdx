After traveling across East Africa, I noticed a glaring absence of coliving spaces — nothing quite like what exists in Mexico, Bali, or South America.

The continent’s rising middle class, remote worker influx, and vibrant startup scenes make it a prime candidate for curated shared living spaces. I believe this will be one of the next big lifestyle trends in Africa.

I’m exploring ways to build or support coliving concepts across the region — and testing demand city-by-city.
