A man dies and he finds himself at the gates of Heaven standing before God. The following conversation is between the man and God.

God: Welcome to heaven my son. I’ve been expecting you.

Man: Thank you, God. I always knew I’ll make it to heaven.

God: Before I let you in, I have one final question.

God: Did you deliver on the purpose I sent you there for?

Man: Of course.

God: Ok great. What was it?

Man: To serve you.

God: No. that’s was not your purpose.

Man: What?

God: Service to me cannot be your purpose.

Man: How can that be? That’s what I was always taught.

Man: My God, all I did was serve you. All I did was praise you. That was my purpose.

God: Regardless of what you believe in, regardless of your religion, regardless of what you do. You are always serving me.

God: By a mere existence, you are serving me.

God: My son, serving me was never your purpose.

God: Because you did not deliver on your purpose, I can’t let you in.

Man: ...begins to cry...

God: My son, Heaven is home.

God: Heaven is where you came from. But the ones who return here are those who have been sent to earth and have delivered on their purpose.

God: For the final time, I’m sending you back.
